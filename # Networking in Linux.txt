* There are some tools and utilities in Linux designed for the administerative purpose which include configuring,maintaining,troubleshooting,managing servers and network.

*the benefit of a network is to share resources across the network and communicate across the network with other users.

# Linux networking commands:
 1. ifconfig: Linux ifconfig stands for interface configurator. we use ifconfig to get the info about the ip address , mac address and MTU(" maximum transmission unit).

2. IP: It has the same purpose as ifconfig. It is updated version of ifconfig.

3. Traceroute: most usefull command , used for troubleshoot. It detects the delay and determine the pathway to your target.

4. Tracepath: similar to traceroute. it is used to detect network delay also it doesn't require root privilges. It is installed in ubunto by default.

5. ping( Packet Internet groper): Most used troubleshooting command. It checks for the network connection b/w two servers. It sends the ICMP echo request to check the connectivity of network.

6. netstat: refers to network  statistics. It provide statistical figure about different interface which includes open sockets, routing tables and connection information.

7. ss: advanced version of netstat. faster and more informative command than netstat because it fetches all the info from eithin the kernel userspace.

8. dig: domain information groper. used to get the info about DNS.

9. nslookup: It also used for DNS related queries but it is an older version of dig.

10. route: To display and manipulates the routing table on your system.It basically used to send packets to a destination

17: whois: to fetch the info related to a webite.

18: ifplugstatus: To check if a cable is plugged into the network interface.

19: iftop: Used in traffic monitoring.

20: tcpdump: Most important command in network analysis among other linux network commands. It captures the traffic that is passing through the network interface and display it.
